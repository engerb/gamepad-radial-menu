# gamepad-radial-menu
A gamepad radial menu prototype for user-testing. It is built in react for the sake of quick testing regardless of the end result being in Vue. You can view the hosted app [here](https://gamepad-radial-menu.herokuapp.com/).

There are 3 styles to test: 2 circle designs based off of a GTA-V weapon select and a third style based off of the new animal crossing menu. Be sure to plug in a game-pad to use this.

# How to run

# How to build and deploy
* Build: `npm run-script build`
